I am Allotey Gerald Abdul Rahman, a 19-year-old from Sempe in the Greater Accra region of Ghana pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in the University of Ghana, Legon. I completed my Junior High School education in 2021 and went on to attend St. Joseph Senior High Technical School in the Ashanti region of Ghana, graduating in 2024 after successfully completing my WASSCE examination. With a strong interest in videogame development, virtual reality, and IT, I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills in innovative ways. In my free time, I enjoy playing videogames and creating art, particularly anime characters, for which I have received recognition and rewards. Upon completing my education, my goal is to support my family and empower children through digital skills education, recognizing the importance of technology in today's world. I am eager to make a positive impact and contribute to the growth and development of my community.
